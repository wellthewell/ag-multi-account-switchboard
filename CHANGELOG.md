# Changelog

All notable changes to **AG Multi-Account Switchboard** are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **Usage Stats missed agy CLI sessions** — Conversations created by the `agy` CLI stopped being counted. The language server only *lists* trajectories it has loaded, so `GetAllCascadeTrajectories` never reports CLI sessions and their `stepCount` stays `0` — the stepCount-delta gate therefore never marked them dirty. Each CLI conversation got exactly one fetch, at creation, while its store was still empty, then sat at zero entries forever. Re-fetch now also triggers on disk mtime (`brain/<id>`, `conversations/<id>.db`), which sees every session regardless of who wrote it. Conversations already stuck at zero entries are retried automatically on the next refresh; ones that already have data are not re-read.
- **Usage Stats delta offsets skipped recoverable rows** — A conversation with zero cached entries is now re-read from offset `0` instead of resuming past metadata/step rows that were fetched but never kept.

## [3.2.1] — 2026-05-04

> First 3.2.x marketplace release. Includes the 3.2.0 Conversation Guard release plus the Usage Stats accuracy fixes below.

### Fixed
- **Usage Stats duplicate counting** — Deduplicates model responses by stable `responseId` when Antigravity exposes the same usage telemetry through both generator metadata and trajectory steps.
- **Usage Stats total token semantics** — Total Tokens now consistently includes input, cache read, cache write, output, and reasoning tokens across sidebar KPIs, full dashboard cards, model totals, and conversation totals.
- **Usage Stats cache rebuild** — Bumped the disk cache schema to v2 so old fingerprint-based caches are discarded and rebuilt with response-aware entries.
- **Usage Stats refresh lifecycle** — The full Usage Statistics editor panel now receives refresh pushes from quota refreshes instead of staying stale until reopened.
- **Usage Stats monthly filters** — Monthly summaries use bounded date filtering and pure aggregation so switching ranges does not mutate cached totals.
- **Footer build number placement** — Build tags render in the footer build badge instead of drifting into the updated timestamp.
- **Quota 100% display bug** — Restored `projectId` parameter in `retrieveUserQuota` API call. Without it, Google returned generic empty buckets showing 100% for all models. (via [#3](https://github.com/erennyuksell/ag-multi-account-switchboard/pull/3) by [@ameenalasady](https://github.com/ameenalasady))

### Changed
- **Usage Stats entry preference** — When the same response appears in multiple local sources, generator metadata is preferred over step snapshots because it carries the canonical token accounting.
- **Model whitelist removed** — All models returned by the API are now displayed, not just hardcoded ones. Unknown model IDs are auto-humanized (`gemini-3.1-pro-high` → `Gemini 3.1 Pro (High)`). The old `MODEL_WHITELIST` is now `MODEL_DISPLAY_NAMES` — a cosmetic override map, not a filter.

## [3.2.0] — 2026-05-01

### Added
- **Conversation Guard** — Detects conversations that exist on disk (`.pb` files) but are missing from the sidebar index. Shows an expandable warning banner with conversation titles and dates, with a one-click fix that rebuilds the index.
- **Detached fix worker** — Index rebuild runs as a standalone Node.js process after AG quits, then auto-relaunches the IDE with the same workspace. Handles WAL checkpoint, backup, and cross-platform app discovery (macOS, Linux, Windows).
- **Protobuf codec** — Pure TypeScript varint encoder/decoder, field stripper, and entry builder. Shared between extension host and detached worker with zero external dependencies.
- **Title resolver** — Multi-source title extraction (LS trajectory → brain markdown → transcript log → date-based fallback). Filters generic auto-titles like "New Conversation".
- **Cross-platform path SSOT** — `agPaths.ts` centralizes all platform-specific filesystem paths (state DB, conversations dir, cert paths, LS binary name) for macOS/Linux/Windows.
- **`ag.fixConversations` command** — Command palette entry + footer wrench button for manual fix trigger.

### Changed
- **Constants refactor** — Platform paths and process detection patterns moved from `constants.ts` to `shared/agPaths.ts` (vscode-free, worker-safe).

## [3.1.1] — 2026-04-28

### Fixed
- **Cross-window state contamination** — Multiple IDE windows no longer overwrite each other's active conversation. Each window uses `workspaceState` for per-workspace cascade persistence.
- **Focus-gain listener bug** — Removed listener that could pick up stale cascade IDs from other windows' USS entries on alt-tab.
- **Disposable leak** — `topic.onDidChange()` subscriptions are now properly registered for disposal.
- **Boot poll snapshot inconsistency** — Boot polling now uses `readCascadeDiff()` to keep the internal snapshot in sync with runtime.
- **trajectorySummaries fallback persistence** — Fallback cascade assignment now writes to `workspaceState`.
- **Log severity** — Error conditions upgraded from `log.info()` to `log.warn()`.

### Changed
- **Quota API endpoint** — Migrated to `retrieveUserQuota` gRPC-transcoded endpoint with strict model whitelist.
- **USS event gating** — `onDidChange` events are only processed when `vscode.window.state.focused` is true.

## [3.1.0] — 2026-04-24

### Added
- **Cross-source pin matching** — Pinned models persist correctly across local/tracked accounts via host-side label map.
- **Host-managed quota polling** — Quota refresh via `setInterval`, ensuring data stays fresh regardless of sidebar visibility.
- **Cost per token in daily grid** — Heatmap cells show estimated cost alongside token counts.
- **Diagnostic logging harness** — DIAG-level logging with file sink for field debugging.
- **Build tag tracking** — Footer shows incremental build identifiers.

### Changed
- **Account card builder refactor** — Pure-function card builder module with zero side effects.
- **Anti-magic constants** — All UI thresholds, timeouts, and API URLs extracted to named constants.

## [3.0.0] — 2026-04-14

### Added
- **Context Window Detail** — Full editor panel with raw token breakdown.
- **Active Context sidebar** — Donut chart with category-colored stacked bar.
- **Export Markdown** — One-click conversation export.
- **LiveStream Watcher** — Real-time context window updates during model execution.
- **RPC Direct Client** — JSON-over-HTTP calls to local LS.
- **Reasoning tokens** — Tracks reasoning tokens alongside input/cache/output.
- **Monthly cost breakdown**, **Weekly pattern**, **Top conversations**.
- **Dual-LS Architecture** — Automatic discovery of Workspace LS + Global LS.
- **Server Discovery rewrite** — PID-based process scanning with `lsof` port resolution.
- **Account Switch Hardening** — LS Readiness Gate, Gate-Once-Pass-Down endpoint reuse.
- **Proactive Token Renewal** — Automatic access_token refresh before expiry.

## [2.3.0] — 2026-03-20

### Added
- **Usage Stats Dashboard** with sidebar compact view + full editor tab.
- 9 KPI cards, estimated cost per model, smart model merging.
- PostMessage architecture for detail panel DOM patching.
